## Hi there 👋 My name is Selvahini.

🎓 First-year Computer Engineering Student @ University of Waterloo

💬 About Me
I'm interested in building scalable, innovative solutions at the intersection of development, AI and machine learning, and embedded systems. I’m particularly passionate about projects that tackle real-world societal challenges such as climate sustainability, accessibility, robotics, and automation.

🔍 What I'm Working On
- 🤖 Exploring AI Agents with a focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in large language models.
- 💻 Gaining hands-on experience with embedded systems (STM32 Nucleo Board) and C++ programming.

🤝 Let's Collaborate
I'm always open to collaborating on projects that make a meaningful impact — especially those that combine hardware and software in creative ways. Feel free to connect via my socials!
