## 💬 About Me
I'm interested in building **scalable**, **innovative** solutions at the intersection of **web** development, **AI** and **machine learning**, and **embedded systems**. I’m particularly passionate about projects that tackle real-world societal challenges such as climate sustainability, accessibility, robotics, and automation.

## 🔍 What I'm Working On
- 🤖 Exploring **AI Agents** with a focus on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** in large language models.
- 💻 Gaining hands-on experience with **embedded systems** (STM32 Nucleo Board) and **C++** programming.

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate
I'm always open to collaborating on projects that make a meaningful impact — especially those that combine hardware and software in creative ways. Feel free to connect via my socials!
